• Developed a Diabetes Prediction Model using the PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset, performing
thorough data analysis to identify patterns between health parameters and diabetes occurrence.
• Applied data preprocessing techniques including feature scaling with StandardScaler and train-test
splitting for balanced model evaluation.
• Trained a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with a linear kernel, achieving 78% accuracy
on training data and 77% accuracy on test data.
